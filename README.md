# KrakenTheCode
Collaborative with artist Krajna Alcantara (ig: @slice.o.onione), a top down dungeon game created with Unity.  Early stages and was only able to make a limited number of levels.
Game is playable on itch.io in-browser: https://vtyiu.itch.io/kraken-the-code-final

Game inspired by Binding of Isaac.

Originally, the game was made to be a 2d platformer which is why the main character's figure does not really fit the game and the style (ex: difficult to dodge the bullets due to the "long" body).  For the second version of the game, we decided to make it a 2d top down dungeon style so we reused the same assets due to time constraints.
The game also has a false sense of choice - there are different exits to the next room but even though the exits are in different places, the room that it exits to is the same.

Successful points:
- Character movement is very responsive to the direction keys that the player uses, including diagonals
- Collectibles disappear and add to the counter once the character makes contact with it
- Obstacles stop the player from moving while keeping the perspective of the game in mind
- Start, Death, and Ending screen - successful game loop
- Successfully implemented sound effects - background music, collecting objects, character getting damaged, cabinets opening
- Player is able to press space to open cabinets
- When all collectibles are collected, the exit doors to the room open
- Very cool enemies: three different types of enemies - ones that are stationary and blink, ones that have their eyes closed, opens when player gets to a certain distance from it, and then the enemy starts chasing the player, and ones that are stationary, blink, and shoot an ink sac at the player

Aspects that can be improved:
- Change the main character's model to be shorter and more fit for dungeon crawler style games
- Add more stages and make it so that the rooms are randomized
- Add to the efficiency of the game - this was my first couple of months using Unity to create games and in order to get some parts to work, I loaded in assets or coded actions in a very roundabout way with the goal simply of getting it to work
- I wanted to make it so that the hitbox and collision box of the character is different - this could have probably been down by intializing two collision boxes on the character and checking for the respective box when hit by either a damage object or obstacle
- Stylize the itch.io link to be more attractive
- Life should not be reset every time the character walks into a new room
